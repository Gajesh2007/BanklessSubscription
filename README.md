## SUMMARY

To grant full access to the Discord channels to non member of the DAO through a subscription

## BACKGROUND

There is a lot of interest in level 0 discord channels in joining the DAO. At the moment only people that hold 35000 BANK can be full members. So could grant access to people that want to engage in Discord and actually be part of projects.

## MOTIVATION

Lots of talent in Level 0 is going to waste, let the people who want to get involved get a feel of what it is all about before actually deciding on getting 35000 BANK. This will also help with the revue issue that the DAO is experimenting in these early days.

## SPECIFICATION

To offer 1 month subscriptions to non members as NFT’s, NFTs cost 50USDC each or 0.02ETH.

The NFT holder gets access to Discord like a full member, can attend meetings, be part of projects, etc but can’t make new proposals as a temporary member could leave the following month risking the completion of the project. So the temporary member can team up with other members of the DAO to make a proposal.

## NEXT STEPS

Get soft consensus in Discord, then forum proposal.As this doesn’t require funding a Snapshot vote won’t be needed.

## CONCLUSION

<<<<<<< HEAD
An easy and straightforward way of getting revenue and a way of getting people onboard Discord in a temporary manner.
